Find Devs
=========

Description
-----------

Having the need/want to look up good developers on GitHub, I started using the GitHub API and location-based
searching. This Node.js script was the result.

Config
------

Copy the config.sample.js file to config.js and then add your own OAuth token.

Usage
-----

    $ node find-devs.js 

Todo
----

- ~~add support for Oauth or Basic Authentication to avoid extremely low rate limits.~~
